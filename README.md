# CosmoML
Testing scripts related to Machine learning applications in Cosmology. 

#### Raw data files (available on Phoenix) must be saved in AllTrainTestSets/. 
However, the codes are generalizable to MNIST/CIFAR10 dataset. 


Other notes: 
1. salloc script and submit scripts are provided for interactive setup and batch submission setup
2. Dependancies: Keras with TensorFlow backend, numpy. If using Gaussian Processes, models such as george and emcee are required.
